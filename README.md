# Intial Ideas
## Healthcare Category
### Idea 1
Create a bot assistant for when patients want to talk with a doctor. The bot would gather basic information about the person and be able to send this information to the doctor so that they already have most of what they need upon the beginning of consultation. The bot would be able to increasingly understand symptom classification using ML or AI based on the descriptions provided from patients. The bot would also ask about prescription medicines that the patient is taking and from there consult a list of known side-effects with those medicines and be able to inform the doctor if it sounds like they have a symptom match. <br><br>
### Idea 2
Improve consultations and diagnoses and monitoring by building an application with live analytics on patient's feelings, medical records, and symptoms. Use ML on all previously stated factors combined with facial expressions of all those in the room to determine the best time to notify a doctor that a patient needs to be seen soon. <br><br>
## Education
Create a bot assistant that can quickly answer questions about the curriculum during lectures and even answer questions that someone may have. Answers could be improved or corrected using ML or AI. Bot could also be able to give surveys to rate different parts of curriculum and even connect a tutor to students. <br><br>
## Sales
Create a bot assistant for salesman that adapts the sales pitch and provides key facts and pointers to sales representatives based on information about the potential client. Use ML to predict when a customer should next be contacted. Connect customers to sales reps based on industry, language, and technical knowledge using ML.
